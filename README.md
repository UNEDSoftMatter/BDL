Brownian Disks Lab (BDL) is a Java-based application for the real-time generation and visualization of the motion of
two-dimensional Brownian disks using Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations. This software is designed to emulate
time-lapse microscopy experiments of colloidal fluids in quasi-2D situations, such as sedimented layers of particles,
optical trap confinement, or fluid interfaces. Microrheology of bio-inspired fluids through optical-based techniques
such as videomicroscopy is a classic tool for obtaining the mechanical properties and molecular behavior of these
materials. The results obtained by microrheology notably depend of the time-lapse value of the videomicroscopy
setup, therefore, a tool to test the influence of the lack of statistics by simulating Brownian objects in experimental-
like situations is needed. We simulate a colloidal fluid by using Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, where the
particles are subjected to different external applied forces and inter-particle interactions. This software has been tested
for the analysis of the microrheological consequences of attractive forces between particles [1], the influence of image
analysis on experimental microrheological results [2], and to explore experimental diffusion with optical tweezers [3].
The output results of BDL are directly compatible with the format used by standard microrheological algorithms [4].
In a context of microrheology of complex bio-inspired fluids, we use this tool here to study if the lack of statistics
may influence the observed potential of a bead trapped by optical tweezers.
